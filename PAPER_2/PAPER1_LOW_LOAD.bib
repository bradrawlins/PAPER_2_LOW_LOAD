abstract = {This paper evaluates a Eulerian-Eulerian modelling of the dispersed two-phase flow in pulverised coal combustion. In contrast to the commonly employed Eulerian-Lagrangian procedures, which treat the gas phase by a Eulerian and the particulate phase by a Lagrangian frame of reference, the presently investigated approach applies a Eulerian description to both phases. In our implementation, the model is further simplified assuming a mechanical and thermal equilibrium between the phases. For validation, two- and three-dimensional furnaces with different thermal loads have been analysed. Results have been compared to those obtained by Eulerian-Lagrangian formulations and measurements. It has been shown that the present Eulerian-Eulerian approach provides a comparable overall accuracy to the Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation, with substantially lower CPU requirements for large-scale utility boilers, and, thus provides an attractive alternative for this bracket of problems.

abstract = {Coal blends are commonly used in pulverised fuel fired power plants. Past experience has shown that some coals exhibit synergistic effects when co-fired with other coals. Despite the recent progress in the field, there is still a general lack of understanding about how and why such synergistic effects take place. It is, therefore, imperative to develop reliable techniques to predict the combustion characteristics of coal blends. In the present paper, a commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package, known as Fluent, is applied to simulate the combustion of binary coal blends of Australian black coals in a pilot-scale furnace. The modelling was mainly concerned with employing the two-mixture-fraction-pdf approach to separately track the individual components of each blend. Additionally, another approach, which takes the blend as a single coal with the weighted average properties of the components, was also used and compared. The main combustion characteristics of coal blends, such as ignition, burnout and NOx emissions were studied and corresponding predictions were validated against measurements in a pilot-scale furnace. The comparisons indicated that the CFD model with the two mixture fraction approach can successfully predict the non-additive (synergistic) combustion behaviour of coal blends, providing an effective tool for full-scale applications. The single coal approach presents nearly additive prediction of coal bends, and is only applicable to the blends of similar coals. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Radiation is the principal mode of heat transfer in a combustor. This paper presents a refined weighted sum of gray gases model for computational fluid dynamics modelling of conventional airâ€“fuel combustion, which has greater accuracy and completeness than the existing gaseous radiative property models. This paper also presents new conversion-dependent models for particle emissivity and scattering factor, instead of various constant values in literature. The impacts of the refined or new models are demonstrated via computational fluid dynamics simulation of a pulverized coal-fired utility boiler. Although the refined gaseous radiative property model shows great advantages in gaseous fuel combustion modelling, its impacts are largely compromised in pulverized solid fuel combustion, in which particle-radiation interaction plays the dominant role in radiation heat transfer due to high particle loading. Use of conversion-dependent particle emissivity and scattering factor will not only change the particle heating and reaction history, but also alter the radiation intensity and thus temperature profiles in the furnace. For radiation modelling in pulverized fuel combustion, the priority needs to be placed on particle radiation and a proper description of particle emissivity and scattering factor is required. The refined gaseous radiative property model is still recommended for use in generic combustion modelling because of its inherent potential in improving the results, even though its advantages may be compromised by particle radiation in some cases. The gas and particle radiation modelling method and the conclusions presented in this paper are also applied to oxy-fuel combustion of pulverized fuels.},

abstract = {Deployment of renewables introduces new regimes of large scale boiler operation. The units are required to operate at flexible rather than baseload mode. One of the requirements is to reduce the minimum load of the existing boilers which adds thermal stress to pressure parts. Significant operational issue is the local overheating of the heat exchangers material due to lower steam flow rates and poor heat dissipation conditions. The problem is particularly intensified in low-pressure reheaters. The current paper demonstrates a novel computational method of predicting tube metal temperature of specific reheater platens. The proposed numerical procedure incorporates coupling of CFD simulations of the boiler fire side with 1-D pipe flow model in the heat exchanger. Simulation results are compared to measurement data. The numerical method can be used to make decision on the modification strategy of the reheater design to achieve uniform temperatures of the tube metal in each platen by restriction orifices adjustment.},

abstract = {The paper investigates the effects of pulverized coal swirl burners' secondary air swirl directions on furnace water-wall, platen superheater and high temperature superheater heat absorption by using numerical simulations. The resultant effect on the carbon-monoxide and unburnt carbon levels was also investigated to establish the furnace performance. The conventional RANS approach was used along with a two-equation turbulence closure model to simulate the multispecies gas phase flow. Fuel particles were modeled as a discrete phase. The gas phase combustion was simulated using the eddy dissipation finite rate kinetics model and the surface reactions using a diffusion-kinetics limited model. To establish the validity of the modelling approach an actual 620 MWe boiler furnace and its superheaters were modelled, and the results compared to processed plant data. Once the model showed that it can predict the plant performance with reasonable accuracy it was used to investigate the performance changes for various burner swirl arrangements. Six swirl arrangement cases were simulated to determine the effect on the furnace performance indicators. It was found that by swirling all the burners per wall in the same direction that the furnace heat absorption could be increased by up to 6.67{\%} and the unburned carbon fraction reduced from 0.029{\%} to 0.022{\%} when compared to the current boiler swirl configuration results, which has a staggered swirl direction arrangement. Furthermore, it was shown that the enhanced mixing in the volume adjacent to the burners also reduced the carbon-monoxide levels. The simulations demonstrated, for the given modelling methodology, that there is indeed interaction between adjacent burners which influences the combustion rate and in turn heat absorption in the water-cooled furnace walls and platen superheater for the modelled boiler.},

abstract = {Investigations suggest the need for better understanding of reactive gas-particle turbulent flow phenomena in full-scale energy systems. Numerical study was done in 350 MWe utility boiler tangentially fired furnace to clarify selected issues, such as turbulence modulation, particles dispersion, energy transfer between phases, combustion process and flame, by using an in-house developed combustion code. Numerical experiments demonstrated remarkable complexity of flow and interphase exchange. Maximal decrease in average turbulence kinetic energy of 33{\%} due to dispersed phase was predicted for representative monodispersed coal; augmentation obtained for large particles could become attenuation due to the particles size change during combustion. Grinding fineness of polydispersed coal affected the flow, combustion and flame considerably. Fine grinding (R90 = 48.40{\%}) provided ascending flame, higher furnace exit temperature and decrease in turbulence energy, compared with coarse grinding (R90 = 73.85{\%}). Combustion of each particle size class of coal is completed at different vertical levels, influencing the flame position. Diagrams based on numerical predictions were proposed to enable efficient estimations of combustion and flame characteristics in the case-study furnace, for various coal qualities and mass fractions and changed distributions of coal particle size classes over the burner tiers, while necessity for further investigation was pointed out as well.},

This enables the direct radiation component to be properly accounted for together with variations in the wall temperatures. The modelling approach was applied to the boiler of a 620 MWe power plant. The results for 99{\%}, 81{\%} and 60{\%} boiler loads compare well with experimental data.

abstract = {Computational modeling of pulverized coal fired boilers has made considerable advances in the past 5 decades. Modeling the furnace of a coal-fired boiler is a complex task. Even though bulk of the heat transfer to the furnace water walls is by radiation, it is complicated by the presence of ash and other tri-atomic gases that participate in radiation. It is also necessary to accurately capture the kinetics of the devolatilization, char combustion and volatile combustion processes. The phenomenon of fluid flow is equally important since considerable amount of turbulence is involved. Any model developed for the prediction of critical performance parameters like furnace outlet gas temperature and pollutant emission levels will need to capture this multifarious nature of combustion inside a boiler furnace. While computationally expensive CFD codes are available in plenty, researchers have also developed simpler but effective reactor network models. This review explains the current research position in the computational modeling of pulverized coal fired boilers from the following perspectives i) Coal combustion modeling ii) Radiation modeling iii) Overall furnace model development.},

A new radiation model that can account for nongray gas-solid mixtures is developed for pulverized coal flames. The new models are validated against a pulverized coal ignition flame. Predictions of velocity, temperature and gas major species are found in good agreement with experiments. Pyrometer measurements of temperature are predicted by a radiation transport calculation. It is found that radiation cooling effects can lead to a 500K temperature decline in solid phases. Radiation also has indirect influence on CO2 predictions through the slow yet strongly temperature-dependent char reaction rates. The consideration of radiation improves predictions of both temperature and CO2 concentrations. Effects of devolatilization model and number of phases are also discussed.},

Results were compared to simulations of similarly designed boiler equipped with traditional jet burners. Furnace simulation was preceded with a single RI-JET2 burner simulation at the inlet to a virtual combustion chamber. The results have shown that pulverized coal (PC) concentrator separates the PC into two streams: concentric with fine particles and axial with coarse particles. Stable flame operation was noticed even without secondary and tertiary air swirl. 3D simulations of combustion chamber have shown that in a burner zone a visibly isolated, concentrated flame exists in the furnace axis. This kind of flame shape reduces corrosion risk and furnace walls slagging as a result of RI-JET2 burner's long range. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
